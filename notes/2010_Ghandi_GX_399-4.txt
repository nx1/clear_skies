variability in the low/hard state
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.407.2166G/abstract
-------------------------

0. Abstact
    - Galactic Black hole binary GX 339-4 in the low/hard state
    - GX 339-4 displays slow (~20s) QPOs as well as fast 50ms flaring activity
      in the optical
    - Power spectral analysis over 0.004 - 10 Hz is presented
    - A large optical to X-ray flux ratio is observed when compared to the jet
      dominated state
    - Studying the X-ray/Optical cross-spectrum in Fourier space shows a markedly
      different behavriour above and below 0.2 Hz
    - The Peak of the cross spectrum corresponds to a lag of 150ms
    - A linear RMS-Flux relationship is seen indicative of propogating fluctuations 
    - The low frequency QPO is seen in the optical but NOT the X-rays
    - There is evidence of reprocessing at the lowest Fourier frequencies with optical
      lags at ~10s and strong coherence in the blue u' filter

1. Introduction

2. Observations and data analysis
    - Observations made in June 2007 over 4 nights separated by two days each
    - 3 optical SDSS bands (r', g', u') were analysed using ULTRACAM
    - ULTRACAM is capable of imaging frame rates upto 500Hz
    - Spectrum were obtained using FORS2
    - X-ray measurements were made with RXTE
    - Lightcurves were barycentered in both the X-ray and Optical
