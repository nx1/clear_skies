https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.407.2166G/abstract
-------------------------

0. Abstact
    - Galactic Black hole binary GX 339-4 in the low/hard state
    - GX 339-4 displays slow (~20s) QPOs as well as fast 50ms flaring activity
      in the optical
    - Power spectral analysis over 0.004 - 10 Hz is presented
    - A large optical to X-ray flux ratio is observed when compared to the jet
      dominated state
    - Studying the X-ray/Optical cross-spectrum in Fourier space shows a markedly
      different behavriour above and below 0.2 Hz
    - The Peak of the cross spectrum corresponds to a lag of 150ms
    - A linear RMS-Flux relationship is seen indicative of propogating fluctuations 
    - The low frequency QPO is seen in the optical but NOT the X-rays
    - There is evidence of reprocessing at the lowest Fourier frequencies with optical
      lags at ~10s and strong coherence in the blue u' filter

1. Introduction

2. Observations and data analysis
    - Observations made in June 2007 over 4 nights separated by two days each
    - 3 optical SDSS bands (r', g', u') were analysed using ULTRACAM
    - ULTRACAM is capable of imaging frame rates upto 500Hz
    - Spectrum were obtained using FORS2
    - X-ray measurements were made with RXTE
    - Lightcurves were barycentered in both the X-ray and Optical

    4.1 Light Curves
        
        Superimposed Shot
        -----------------
        - The flare-like events seen in the lightcurves are known as `shots'
        - The analysis of these shots may be carried out via method of
          superimposing these shots.
        - This method can extract key physics from the complex light curves in the X-rays

        Light Curve binning and co-adds
        -------------------------------
            variables: t_bin, N_co_adds
            - What are the N_co_adds = 50 co-adds for each u' data point?
            - X-ray data is binned to t_bin = 50ms

        Flare Selection
        ---------------
            variables: f, t_m, t_p
        - Flares selected by having a peak that is
            f = CR_max / CR_mean
          above the mean count rate in a t_m = 32 s long section
          the flares were also selected to be within continuous
          segments of atleast t_p = +- 4s

       4.1.1 
        - The tail of the flares are fitted with an exponential decay of the
          form:
            A * exp(-t / tau)
          tau was found to be of around ~0.01 meaning that the fastest rise and
          fall timescales of the optical flaring probed are only of around
          100ms

        - The flare can also be fit with both the rise and decay, allowing to
          see if the flares are asymetrical


        - What is the origin of this fast flaring?
    
   4.2 Power Spectra 
        - The power spectral density (PSD) are computed as the modulus square of
          the discrete Fourier transforms of the light curves.

        - The Frequencies in the PSD go from 1 / N dt to the Nyquist frequency 1 / 2 dt
          and are evenly spaced and N/2 in number.

        - The normalization used is the standard rms-squared one

        4.2.1 : Noise Levels
            - Poisson uncertainties introduce a constant white noise level, which becomes
              increasingly important at high Fourier frequencies.

            - How does poission uncertainties lead to white noise?


5. Discussion
    - The LF-QPO is not new, but its detection across multiple wavelengths has now
    been established. Also, there is now a much larger range of frequencies that has
    been invesitgated for the source extending to ~10Hz.

    - The origin of the source emission at multiple wavelengths is still uncertain however
    possible explaination are:
        - Disc Emission
        - Relativistic Jet Plasma
        - Non-relativistic cyclosynchrotron emission from the corona

    - The X-rays are proposed to originate from:
        - Compton upscattering of Seed photons from the disc or the jet.
        - Optically-thin jet synchrotron emission.



7. Conclusions

- Origin of the optical QPO still remains unclear.
- Longer follow ups would enhance the constraints
