Clear Skies Meeting #1
----------------------
Questions:
- Scientific
    - What are the N_co_adds = 50 co-adds for each u' data point?
    - What is the origin of this fast flaring?
    - How does poission uncertainties lead to white noise?

- Project
    - What do you think the timeline for the project will look like?

        - One of the things mentioned was that it would be good to have a model
          for the air pollution metric, then we could see if it significantly
          above or below the model.

    - What are the key milestones?
    - I will keep a continuous monolithic journal for the days I work on the
      project starting today.

- Administrative
    - Shall I reach out to Dr Nicholas Marsden at Manchester for data.
    - Will I be paid restroactively?

- Logistical
    - How often should we have meeting be?
    - How can we best make this project a success?
    - What is your prefered method of supervision?

NO_x is NOx is shorthand for nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO_2)
NOx does not include nitrous oxide (N_2 O)

NOy is defined as the sum of NOx plus the NOz compounds produced from the
oxidation of NOx which include nitric acid, nitrous acid (HONO), dinitrogen
pentoxide (N2O5), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), alkyl nitrates (RONO2),
peroxyalkyl nitrates (ROONO2), the nitrate radical (NO3), and peroxynitric acid
(HNO4). See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx


I have downloaded some data from the UK Air Information Data Archive for Southampton
Center and also Tower Hamlets.

The data has a frequency of 1hr intervals and contains NaN values that could
realisitically be interpolated.

NO, NO2 and NOXasNO2 are all strongly correlated
PM10 and PM25 are also strongly correlated.

NO and SO2 are correlated at r~0.6

[x] Create PSDs from the data

A comon method of analysing PSDs in astronomy is by decomposing the spectrum into
a summation of Lorentzian components.

For example in GX339-4 it is found that three Lorentzian components are capable of
describing the spectrum.

Fitting a single Lorentzian to the data is fairly trivial, however specifying
an arbitrary number of fit variables using scipy.optimize becomes rather messy
very quickly as the parameters must be processed in the function by their index
eg. params[0], and then then must be collected up at the end while keeping
track of the order. Although this is doable, the lmfit provides a provides a
high-level interface to non-linear optimization and curve fitting problems for
Python. It builds and expands on many of the methods found in scipy.optimize
and seems suitable for this paticular problem.



# TODO (x:done -:started)
[-] Read through and take notes on GX399-4 Paper.
[ ] Create cross correlations
[ ] Create Lorentzian fits to PSD
[ ] Normalize PSDs
[ ] Create Python package
